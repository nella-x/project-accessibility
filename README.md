# project-accessibility

This week I wanted to do a new version of my first project (news site).

I also wanted to use the JS that I have learn't during the last sprint, so I used an array with objects to create the content for the news articles. I have reused the design and structure, from the first news site, for the responsive design.

I wanted to have buttons that lets the user stay on the same page while reading the full news article. I also made buttons to make it easy to navigate and open/close the expanded article.

I'm happy with the results! If I would change anything, it would be to add extra styling for the buttons (hover, active etc.) and to have a clickable hamburger button.
